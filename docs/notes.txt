Place to hold random notes regarding system configuration. with the idea of automating the installation from a vanilla debian based OS with systemd :O

# RTC / HW CLOCK 
----------
fake-hwclock was interferring with our rtc+hwclock! Removed from this image. sudo apt-get -y remove fake-hwclock && udo update-rc.d -f fake-hwclock remove

also for systemd: 
sudo nano /lib/udev/hwclock-set and comment out these three lines:
#if [ -e /run/systemd/system ] ; then
# exit 0
#fi
