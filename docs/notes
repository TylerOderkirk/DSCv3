Removed tabs from crypto.py
Integration keyset generation / random keyset password and yubikey slot setting
Optimized radio tx msg sending freq. (reduced tx_throttle). We don't need to put the radio into
rx mode when tdma slot is active!
Removed sys.exit from crypto.gen_keysets. Return true/false instead
Decrease yubikey thread sleep to consistently capture the 38byte keyset password

Refactoring UI and DISPLAY thread. The display thread will simply be in charge of drawing content provided by UI to the oled.
Populating UI/Menu's and Dialogs.

Keyset/password generation Process via UI almost complete.
1. Check for existing keysets (If so, then bail, force user to factory reset before generating new keys)
2. Generate 38byte password
3. Generate enc/dec sig/validate keys and encrypt private keys with password
4. set password to slot1 of yubikey
5. (NOT DONE). Validate yubikey can unlock keyset (if not, bail, wipe keys, force user to retry)

Keyset Password length = 38bytes (max size for yubikey static password in a slot)

Off by one in crypto.generate_random_password(length), fixed.

Working out mechanisms for managing the transfer of public keys (using a usb drive).

TODO: Optimize yubikey thread, it consumes 15% cpu load when plugged in.
