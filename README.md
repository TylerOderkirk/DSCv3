[What is Dirt Simple Comms (DSC) ?]
------------------

[Goals]
----------------
 1. To not require existing infrastructure
 2. To operate well and propage messages in poor rf environments.
 3. To securely exchange messages with friends in hostile rf environments. 
 4. To avoid central points of control in the system design.
 5. To keep the attack surface as small as possible.
 6. Make it easy to use and hard to mess up.
 7. To leak as little data as possible.
 8. Low Cost / Low Power / Long Range
 9. Small Form Factor / Portable
 10. Utilize LoRA Modulated 900mhz Radio System
